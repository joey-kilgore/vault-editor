# Vault Editor

Small Python tools for working with an Obsidian vault.

## Setup
1. Install deps:
   - `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Update `secrets.json` with your vault path and preferences.

## Image insertion tool
This tool scans notes for image markers and replaces them with an image embed.

**Marker format** (inside your note):
```
<!-- IMAGE: golden retriever puppy -->
```

Optionally add an alt text:
```
<!-- IMAGE: golden retriever puppy | Puppy playing in grass -->
```

### Run (dry-run by default)
```
python scripts/insert_images.py
```

### Apply changes
```
python scripts/insert_images.py --apply
```

### Limit to one note (relative to vault)
```
python scripts/insert_images.py --note "Notes/MyNote.md" --apply
```

## Backups
Each modified note is backed up to the `backup_dir` (see `secrets.json`) before changes are applied.
